The Gizmo platform is made up of software, hardware, and other
resources developed by a team of engineers who want to help you build
cool stuff.  You can use the Gizmo to build a robot, create an
interactive art project, or as part of a larger project.

Our platform is designed to be a turn-key system for competition
robotics, and we're proud to be working with [BEST
Robotics](https://bestrobotics.org) to deliver the Gizmo for limited
Pilot as part of the 2024 game year.

The Gizmo started as an idea of what was the minimum amount of stuff
you could add to the popular Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller to make
it function as a complete robot controller without it being too
complicated to use.  The Gizmo is heavily inspired by the amazing work
done by [Parallax Inc](https://www.parallax.com) and their BoE
concept.
