There's lots of ways you can get in touch with us.

## GitHub

For technical questions, we invite you to use our [GitHub
Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/gizmo-platform/discussions)
boards to receive assistance with programming or other technical
matters.

## Zulip Chat

We maintain a realtime Zulip Chatroom for assistance from peers and
general questions.  You can find that
[here](https://gizmo.zulipchat.com).  Kids remember you need to ask
your parent's permission before going online!

## Email Us

For all other matters, please send us an email to `contact {at}
gizmoplatform.org` and a member of the team will get back to you as
soon as we're able.
